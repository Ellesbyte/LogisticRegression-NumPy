# Logistic Regression Classifier with NumPy

# Overview
This repository contains a Python implementation of a logistic regression classifier using only NumPy. Logistic regression is a popular machine learning algorithm used for binary classification tasks.
This project was meant as a learning task for myself to implement a NumPy approach to machine learning and demystify what's going on under the hood.
